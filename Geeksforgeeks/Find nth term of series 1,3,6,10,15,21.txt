/************************************************************************
Given a number N, find the Nth term in the series 1, 3, 6, 10, 15, 21â€¦

 

Example 1:

Input :
N = 4 
Output:
10
Explanation:
The 4th term of the Series is 10.
Example 2:

Input :
N = 3 
Output:
6
Explanation:
The 3rd term of the Series is 6.
 

Your Task:
You don't need to read input or print anything. Your task is to complete the function findNthTerm() which takes an Integer N as input and returns the answer.

 

Expected Time Complexity: O(1)
Expected Auxiliary Space: O(1)

 

Constraints:
1 <= N <= 104
