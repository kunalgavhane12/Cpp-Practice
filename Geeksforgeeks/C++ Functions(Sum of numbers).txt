/*********************************************************************
Given three numbers A, B, C you have to write a function named calcSum() which takes these 3 numbers as arguments and returns their sum.

Input:
The input line contains T, which denotes the number of testcases. Then T test cases follow. Each test case consists of a single line which contains three space separated integers A, B, and C.

Output:
Corresponding to each testcase, output sum of A, B and C in a new line.

User Task:
Since this is a functional problem you don't have to worry about input, you just have to complete the function calcSum().

Constraints:
1 <= T <= 105
1 <= A <= 102
1 <= B <= 102
1 <= C <= 102

Example:
Input:
3
1 2 3
5 6 7
2 5 3

Output:
6
18
10

Explanation:
Testcase 1: Sum of the given 1,2 and 3 is 6.
